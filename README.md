# cute-email-spammer

## how to use
1. run the script
2. paste email
3. let it do its magic
4. enjoy ^_^
5. there is no step 5
  
i wanted to make an exe version but it requires install

i also wanted a web version but im bad at javascript and chatgpt cannot make it properly

## tldr
- this is just some shitty email spammer script i made
- you can flood inboxes of people u don't like
- i didn't bother too much with optimisation
- 60% success rate (some apis might have changed how they work because of me lol)
- i live in the uk so some apis may not work for you
