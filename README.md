## info
- if you for some reason need to flood people's inboxes please only use it on bad people
- this is just some shitty email spammer script i made
- u can flood inboxes of people u don't like
- i didn't bother with optimisation so ur gonna have to be patient
- around 70% success rate (some apis might have changed how they work because of me lol)
- i live in the uk so some apis may not work for you

## extra info
- if you want to "debug" which sites do and do not work, set threads to 1 and a file named "results.txt" will record all responses
- please let me know what websites consistently don't work
- please also give me site recommendations because i found half of these random sites by googling "... shop"
